## Description
- Motivation: My motivation for making this was to streamline the process for making ReadMe's for myself in the future.
- Why: I built this application in order to be able to more efficiently accomplish a repetitive task
- What problem does this solve: This ReadMe generator solves the problem of having to start from scratch on a ReadMe each time I create a new project
- What I learned: I learned how to use node.js to utilize the command line in order to execute programs.
- Challanges: The biggest challenge I faced was creating the switch statement to populate the appropriate license badge depending on which license the user chose.
